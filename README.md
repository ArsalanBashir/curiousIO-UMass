Getting Started With Artificial Intelligence
============================================

As a part of the University of Massachusetts Tech Talks series, on 17th February, 4PM EST, I spoke to a bunch of students about the fundamentals of artificial intelligence based systems, and how we can practically apply the theoretical aspects to everyday use. This is the official repository containing code samples and reading material from the talk.

The talk was structured in following manner — 

1. Introduction
2. About this talk
3. Why Python
4. Why Artificial Intelligence
5. Machine Learning
6. Supervised learning
7. Unsupervised learning
8. Implementing in Python
9. Questions
10. Wrap Up
